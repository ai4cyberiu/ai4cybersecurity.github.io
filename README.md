# Introduction and Industry Background

## Overview
The connection between healthcare and economic development is greatly impacted by factors like the health of the population, which results in greater efficiency and increased per capita income. Healthcare plays a vital role in driving economic development, and the significance of human capital in fostering economic growth cannot be emphasized enough.

## Data
Patient information is collected from various healthcare sources, including hospitals, emergency and home care services, and contains crucial information about diagnoses. This information may include personal details such as names, addresses, age, family history, and social security numbers. As a result, healthcare data is a prime target for cyber attacks, and it is crucial to have proper cybersecurity measures in place to protect it.

## Cyber Information
The healthcare industry has been facing persistent cyberattacks since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The CyberPeace Institute has studied data from 33 countries and analyzed over 235 cyberattacks, excluding data breaches, on the healthcare sector. These attacks have resulted in the theft of more than 10 million records, which include private information like social security numbers, medical records, financial data, and confidential information of medical donors. On average, each attack breaches around 155,000 records, but some incidents have caused the breach of over 3 million records.
Project Scope: Our project will be centered specifically on the hospital sector.

## The role of technology in the healthcare sector, specifically within hospitals, is of great importance: 

1. Medical devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT).
2. Technologies such as mobile health and telehealth.
3. The impact of the Cures Act on remote patient access.
4. IT departments should be well staffed and funded.
5. Sufficient training provided to employees regarding security.
6. Safeguarding patients' privacy and records against both external and internal risks.
7. Compliance with regulations.
8. Increased efficiency.
9. Reduction in expenses and greater value.
10. Development of hospital brand credibility and reputation.
